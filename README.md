# Capstone-I-Databases
A program for entering, searching, deleting, and updating books in a database

## Project Description
This project is intended as a library/books database. It stores information such as, the books id, title, author, the year it
was published, and the quantity of each book currently in stock. The program requred user input to begin and asks which task
